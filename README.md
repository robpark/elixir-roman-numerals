Elixir Roman Numerals
=====================

For the rules related to Roman Numerals see the [Agile Katas](http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/RomanNumerals-Kata#) site

Run the tests: `mix test`

Note: with the combined test looking at 1..2000, the test suite runs for almost 2 minutes

To play with the conversion: 

* `iex -S mix`
* Once in iex, you can run the conversion `Arabic.to_roman 1`
